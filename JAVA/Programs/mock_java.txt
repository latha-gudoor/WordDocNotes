JAVA MOCK:
1.Benefits of OOPS?
1.Reusability
2.Extensibility
3.ReImplementation
4.Modularity
5.Security purpose

2. What is an Exception?
Ans.Run time error is called as an Exception.
Error : which comes at the time of development
Bug : which comes at the time of testing / pre release
Defect : which comes at the time of production / post release

3. Why Exception Handling Mechanism?
to handle the run time weeor...to avoid abnormal termination.

4. What code we will write with in try,Catch and Finally blocks ?
try block :while developing the prog write one statement which may throw an error 
catch block : we have to write the statements to display user friendly messages
finally block : error free or cleaning up code , code that is irrespective of the cleanup code

5.what is thread?
is an independent execution path ...able to run with other execution paths.

6.what is the baseclass library for the threading ? 
system.threading is the base class library

7.what are oops principles ?
Encapsulation
data abstraction
polymorphism
inheritance

8.What is Encalsulation ?
Wrapping states and behaviours...by implementing the class we can achieve encapsulation.

9.what is polymorphism? types of polymorphism ?
implementing mutiple functinalities with the same name : two types 
1.static polymorphism 
2.dynamic polymorphism

10.what are static and dynamic polymorphisms.
static : method which bind at complie time and which will execute at runtime or early binding time binding , compile time polymorphisms.
Dynamic : method which will bind at compile time will not execute instead of that it will be binded andexecuted at runtime is called dynamic polymorphism, late binding,or runtime polymorphism.
