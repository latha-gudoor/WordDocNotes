                                                                #AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK#


1) What is Automation framework?
Is a systematic approach to automate software process in order to provide Resuasability and maintaibility.

2)Language used is java ,for testing i have used junit and TestNg to run the test cases in form of suites.

3)Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model).
 It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation. It simplifies the build process like ANT.
 Maven lets you get your package dependencies easily we don't have to export all project related jars every time.
 We put the project related dependency in pom.xml.

4)What Framework is used?

Modular Framework:Reusable code put in some functions and functions getting called where and whenever needed.

DataDriven Framework:This Can Be acheievd in two ways 1)Data is tested with help of external files excel ,csv,xml etc
                                                      2)By using annotations @Test(dataprovider="getData") 
                                                        same name as the name of method 
                                                        @DataProvider
                                                         public object[][]getData(){
                                                         return new object[][]{}
                                                             }  

KeyDriven Framework:Automation based on keywords specified in the excel sheet .
example:Keyword "login" will be used in our automation framework, to the test the login function or action associated with it.


HybridFramework:Is a combination of two above two framework.
I have use DataDriven and Modular Framework.


5)In order to increase reusability we use different patterns like PageObjectPatter,Singleton Pattern and PageFactory pattern.

 What is PageObjectPattern:
 There is a clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators (or their use if you’re using a UI Map) and layout.
 where is page of a website is connected to specific class.


6)Stored Different Webdrivers in Resource file and for their cofiguration used Config-Properties.

7)Minimal changes are required as well as should support different version and multiple envoirement.

8)Use Log-4jfor generating logs.

9) Package division: Base(DRiver connectivity)
                     Helper
                     Page
                     Test
